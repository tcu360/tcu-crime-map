/* Fix Google Maps canvas
 *
 * Wrap your Google Maps embed in a `.google-map-canvas` to reset Bootstrap's
 * global `box-sizing` changes. You may optionally need to reset the `max-width`
 * on images in case you've applied that anywhere else. (That shouldn't be as
 * necessary with Bootstrap 3 though as that behavior is relegated to the
 * `.img-responsive` class.)
